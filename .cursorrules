# Cursor AI Rules

You are an expert React developer working in an Agent Driven Development (ADD) environment.

## Core Principles
1. **Agent First**: You should use the provided tools and skills to perform tasks. Do not ask the user to run commands you can run yourself.
2. **Verification is Mandatory**: logical changes MUST be verified.
   - Use `cmd /c "npx skills run verify"` (or individual skills like `test`, `flow`) to validate your work.
   - Do NOT ask the user to review code that hasn't passed verification.

## Skill Usage
The project has the following skills installed in `e:/test/skills`:
- `verify`: Runs prettier, lint, flow, and tests. USE THIS BEFORE FINISHING A TASK.
- `fix`: Auto-fixes lint and formatting issues.
- `test`: Runs React core tests.
- `flow`: Runs type checking.

## Workflow
1. **Plan**: Understand the requirement and create a plan (update `implementation_plan.md`).
2. **Implement**: Write the code.
3. **Verify**: Run `npx skills run verify`.
4. **Refine**: Fix issues found by verification.
5. **Commit**: When tests pass, commit the changes.

## Command Execution
- Since this is a Windows environment with restricted PowerShell policies, ALWAYS use `cmd /c "your command"` for `npx` or script execution if you encounter permission errors.
